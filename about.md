#Who Are You?

I am currently a PhD student at Georgia Tech studying Computational Science and Engineering and Industrial Engineering.  Essentially, I do Computer Science mixed with Statistics and Modeling.  I'm 25 years old and I've lived in Atlanta, Georgia my whole life.  I have a BS in Industrial Engineering and a MS in Health Systems, both from Georgia Tech.  

#What Is This?

This is a place for me to write down whatever I'm thinking about at the moment.  Sometimes it's an analysis of a dataset, sometimes it's a tutorial, and sometimes it's a data visualization.  My research primarily revolves around healthcare, so most of the content on here will be along those lines.  I dabble in sports statistics so that will pop up occasionally.

#What Do You Do All Day?

Projects I'm currently working on:

* Asthma baseline metrics for children on Medicaid in Georgia.
* Small area estimates of childhood obesity prevalence (in partnership with the CDC).
* Classifying asthma severity from Medicaid claims data.

Projects I've worked on in the past:

* Agent-based simulation of a flu outbreak in Georgia.
* Optimizing global cholera vaccine distribution.
* Small area estimates of childhood asthma prevalence.
* Analyzing boarding time in an Atlanta area emergency room.
* Medical cart inventory management.
* Improving sound levels in a neonatal intensive care unit.

I'm also the sole TA for the Georgia Tech MS Analytics program and I'm still taking classes as well.
